# About the CORS

Webpack + ReasonReact + CORS

### (separate) Frontend :3000

Frontend is a simple webpack project with ReasonReact(+Hooks). The source code is in the 'my-frontend' folder. HtmlWebpackPlugin handles 'src/index.html' which is generated by the Bucklescript from 'src/Index.re'.

### (separate, obsolete) Backend :8000

Original backend is the webpack-dev-server configured in webpack.config.js as devServer.
You can run it as 'npm run server', where server is an alias for 'webpack-dev-server'

### (single port) Backend + Frontend :3000

*Run it as 'npm run server2'*, where server2 is an alias for 'node server.js'. 
The server.js file is a simple Express server with webpack-dev-middleware:

```
// Tell express to use the webpack-dev-middleware and use the webpack.config.js configuration file as a base.
app.use(webpackDevMiddleware(compiler, {
  publicPath: config.output.publicPath
}));
```
